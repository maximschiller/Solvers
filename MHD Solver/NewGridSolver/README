PROCESS OF GEOMETRY BUILDING

1. Create geometry in python script
2. call condi, diverging, cylindrical or conical to generate boundary coordinate text files
3. run the c++ mesh generation computed
4. call meshplot from geometry folder

OVERVIEW OF SOLVING

1. Build gometry in geometry folder using python script - (need to make sure that jmax/imax < spacing in python file)
2. Initial Grid is computed using a transinite grid and then using poissons equation
3. Cell vertices and centres are stored in cartesian coordinates
4. Exisiting solver by sankaran is modified to calculate fluxes, sources and advection/diffusion in a non-orthogonal grid
